## Description

### 1. **Age Calculator (age.py)**

This script allows the user to input their birthdate and calculates their current age based on the current date. This program helps you practice basic input handling, date manipulation, and conditionals.

---

### 2. **Calculator (calco.py)**

A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This script helps practice implementing functions, handling user inputs, and managing basic control flow.

---

### 3. **Digital Clock (clock.py)**

This script creates a simple digital clock using Python's `Tkinter` library for GUI. It shows real-time updates of the current time in a graphical window, offering a good exercise for working with time and GUI elements.

---

### 4. **GPA Calculator (GPA.py)**

A program designed to calculate a student's GPA based on their grades. This script involves loops, conditionals, and the handling of input and output, as well as basic arithmetic to determine the GPA.

---

### 5. **Guess the Computer Number (guess_computer.py)**

In this game, the computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the user must guess it. This is a good script to practice loops, conditionals, and random number generation in Python.

---

### 6. **Number Guessing Game (Guess.py)**

This script allows the user to guess a randomly generated number, with feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. It offers valuable practice for handling user inputs and implementing a game loop.

---

### 7. **Odd-Even Checker (Odd-Even.py)**

A simple script that checks whether a given number is odd or even. This program practices basic logic, user input handling, and conditionals in Python.

---

### 8. **Snake Game (snake_game.py)**

A classic Snake game where the player controls a snake to collect food and avoid crashing into the walls or itself. This project is an excellent practice for using Python's `pygame` library to create games, handle graphics, and work with more advanced concepts such as object collision.

---

### 9. **Speech Recognition (speech_recognition.py)**

This script utilizes Python's `speech_recognition` library to convert spoken words into text. It is ideal for learning about integrating third-party libraries, handling audio input, and performing basic natural language processing tasks.

---

### 10. **String Analysis (string_analysis.py)**

A program that takes a string input from the user and performs various analyses such as counting characters, checking for palindromes, and more. This is a great exercise for mastering string manipulation and regular expressions in Python.

---

### 11. **Tic-Tac-Toe vs Computer (tic_tac_toe_vs_computer.py)**

This script allows the user to play Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer. It combines basic game mechanics with AI logic for determining the computer's moves. This is an excellent script for practicing logic, recursion, and implementing simple artificial intelligence.

---

### 12. **Bags of Words Model (bags.py)**

This script demonstrates the **Bag of Words** model, which is a popular text representation technique used in natural language processing (NLP). It helps convert text into a format that a machine learning model can work with. This script involves text preprocessing, tokenization, and vectorization.

---

### 13. **Sentiment Intensity Analyzer (SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.py)**

This script uses the **VADER Sentiment Analysis** library to analyze the sentiment of a given text. It detects whether the sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative and provides a sentiment score. This is a great script for learning about sentiment analysis and integrating NLP libraries.

---

### 14. **Password Hashing with Tkinter (TK_hash_pass.py)**

This script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for securely hashing a password. It uses Python's `hashlib` library for hashing and the `Tkinter` library for creating the GUI. It allows users to input their password, hash it, and view the resulting hash. This script is perfect for learning about password security and GUI development.

---
